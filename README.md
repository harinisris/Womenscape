# Inspiration
Womanscape is a website aimed to encourage women in tech by providing them useful resources. There is no question that women are underrepresented in the tech sector, from entry-level positions all the way up to management and leadership positions. According to a 2020 study by the AnitaB.org Institute, women now make up 28.8% of the IT workforce, up from 25.9% in 2018 and 26.2% in 2019. The most recent survey examined information on more than 500,000 American technicians working for 51 participating companies. However, at the current rate, it might take more than ten more years for women to achieve parity in the tech industry.

# What it does
• Community: A tech community attracts the kind of people who are keen to help one another. So, often simply by being part of a community, many entrepreneurs find experts in everything from marketing and sales, to software development and legal matters to guide them along the way.

• Opportunities: You can find opportunities for internships and hackathons to advance your professional growth.

• Online courses: Online classes, which are frequently asynchronous and don't have a set timetable like traditional classes do, provide you the flexibility to arrange your lessons however you like.

• Motivation: Get motivational message, Motivation is important because it: provides you with goals to work towards, helps you solve problems, helps you to break bad behaviors.

# How we built it
For frontend, I used the templating language EJS in combination with CSS. When I was using EJS, I made sure to use stuff like partials. I also used NodeJS to put up a small web server, and everything was constructed using Repl.it, an in-browser IDE that was great for collaborating and giving feedback in real time. And I have used twilio for sending motivational messages.

# Challenges we ran into
This is the first time I’m using twilio. So, I had no idea about it. At first I was struggling to send messages through twilio but finally I made that happen. I'm proud of what I've accomplished in just a few hours. Managing my time while working on this project was a struggle for me. Furthermore, determining which features to include was a difficult task. I had so many various ideas, but I realized I wouldn't be able to apply them all, so I had to pick a few.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
I was delighted with myself for being able to code a fully functional website, create a slide deck, and record and edit my pitch video in only a few hours. This hackathon allowed me to learn a lot about technology I had never used before, and I'm glad I was able to do that.

# What we learned
The research I did for this website has undoubtedly increased my awareness of how widespread the affects of women in technology are and how important it is to find solution. Technically speaking, this was my first significant Twilio project. I learned a lot about how to use format elements on webpages. However, I'm still quite new to web development, I generally learn something new with each project I work on, whether it be creating a specific component or simply designing the entire page.

# What's next for Womenscape
I'd like to finish implementing some of the functionality, like user authentication, that I wasn't able to achieve today. Additionally, the website will be expanded, allowing it to display opportunities that are available in real time, as well as more courses.
